# Beer's Works

## Description

This page contains some links to other projects I have deployed. Previously, I had no place to group and display my works. I wanted to remedy this. Quite frankly, it taught me alot about CSS styling. The capabilities of CSS are impressive to say the least.  Long story short, this repository functions as a placeholder for my current and future works. 

## Issues Faced

The links' background images kept blocking the hover effect I attempted to add. remedied this by varying the opacity of certain elements.
The webpage was not responsive to viewing on smaller devices. I used media queries to remedy this.
